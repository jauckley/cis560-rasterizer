# Rasterizer and Camera
This is a graphics project in which I implemented a rasterization algorithm to render geometries. An interactive perspective projection camera projects 3D polygons into a 2D space, where a 2D triangle rasterization algorithm renders the polygons to the screen on a per-pixel level.

This project was for a course at the University of Pennsylvania, so the code cannot be publicly displayed due to academic integrity policies. Recruiters interested in the specifics of my work can contact me at jauckley@seas.upenn.edu.

Here are some images to demonstrate the rasterizing of a Mario OBJ file:

This shows Mario rendered using the Blinn Phong reflection model, with the light source placed slightly to the right of the camera-

Here Mario is rendered with Iridescent shading-

And here he is with the same reflection model but in wireframe-
