# Rasterizer and Camera
This is a graphics project in which I implemented a rasterization algorithm to render geometries. An interactive perspective projection camera projects 3D polygons into a 2D space, where a 2D triangle rasterization algorithm renders the polygons to the screen on a per-pixel level.

Here are some images to demonstrate the rasterizing of a Mario OBJ file:

This shows Mario rendered with Blinn Phong shading, with the light source placed slightly to the right of the camera-

Here Mario is rendered with iridescent shading-

And here he is with the same shading but in wireframe-
